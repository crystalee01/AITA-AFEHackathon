# AITA-AFEHackathon
AITA (Artificial Intelligence Teaching Assistance) is an Alexa skill collaboratively developed at the 2020 Amazon Future Engineer Hackathon by Crystal Lee, Zachary Heidel (@zach332), and Fady Besada (@fadybesada). 

AITA allows students and teachers to customize timers for specific work periods and play soothing music to aid students in concentration. This Alexa skill was designed with these features to help students establish a productive working environment from home and assist teachers with establishing structured classroom routines. 

Note: Our Alexa skill was built using provisioned AWS resources provided at the hackathon; therefore all functionality using AWS resources in our skill are unsupported at this time. 

## Interacting with AITA
- To create a new timer: <em>"Alexa, set [homework time] for [15 minutes]. </em>
- To start a timer: <em>"Alexa, start [homework time]." </em>
  - Alexa will ask the student/teacher if they'd like to play music; respond with Y/N answer.
